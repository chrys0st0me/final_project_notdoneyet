<h3>A 'lil introduction:</h3>
<p class="p-red"> 
    Hi! My name is Lucia, and I am an icon painter in the <br>
    midst of a math and comspci degree. I have 5 animals (it escalated somehow) <br>
    and I live with my large family in an old home. <br>

    </p>
    <h3>A little bit about my favorite interest: Painting</h3>
<p class="p-beige">
    Francisco de Zurbar√°n is my absolute favorite painter. He is a Spanish <br>
    iconographer from the 17th century. He was known for painting incredibly itricate <br>
    oils of female Saints. I'll show you some! So, his beautiful art is what I aspire too. <br> <br>

    The incredible detail of his skirts is especially unique and wonderful. 
    <br> I love adding color to my sketches on wood canvas after I draw out what Saint I'm going to paint. <br>
    I also love gold plating them and giving them away. My family is all Catholic, so they <br>
    thoroughly enjoy them. It's also how I unwind, since I don't really enjoy television.
